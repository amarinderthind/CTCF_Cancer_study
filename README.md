# Study Title: CTCF Binding Site Mutations: Linking Topologically Associated Domains Dysregulation to Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Progression 

**Background**:
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the most common lethal malignancy with metastatic potential. The high mutational burden in cSCC has made it difficult to under-stand the significance of variants in the noncoding and regulatory genome. This study presents the first investigation of mutations at CCCTC-binding factor binding sites (CTCFbs) of topologically associating domains (TADs) across defined stages of disease progression â€”primary tumours that have not metastasized, primary tumours that have metastasized, and lymph node metastasis

This repository contains R scripts used in the analysis of CTCF binding site mutation for its role in cancer progression.

1) **Loop-genes-association.r** is used to explore the association between mutations in CTCF binding sites (CTCFbs) and changes in expression for genes located within TAD loops under investigation.
2) **various-Genomic-regions-Backgroud-rate-comparison.R** : Comparison of mutation density between genomic regions and their background using various scaling factors.
3) **ctcfmut-vs-gene-expression-permutations.R** : This script performs a permutation test to evaluate whether the observed association between CTCF loop mutations and gene expression is statistically significant by comparing against a null distribution generated over 1,000 randomized iterations.
4) ** cancer-progression-analysis-PNM-vs-PM.r** : This script analyzes the association between CTCF binding site mutations and cSCC progression by comparing mutation frequencies across tumor subgroups and identifying differentially mutated loops and associated gene expression changes.
