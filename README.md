# Study Title: CTCF Binding Site Mutations: Linking Topologically Associated Domains Dysregulation to Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Progression 

Background
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the most common lethal malignancy with metastatic potential. The high mutational burden in cSCC has made it difficult to under-stand the significance of variants in the noncoding and regulatory genome. This study pre-sents the first investigation of mutations at CCCTC-binding factor binding sites (CTCFbs) of topologically associating domains (TADs) across defined stages of disease progression â€”primary tumours that have not metastasized, primary tumours that have metastasized, and lymph node metastasis

This repository contains scripts used in the analysis of CTCF binding site mutation for its role in cancer progression.

1) The script named "Loop-genes-association.rmd" is used to explore the association between mutations in CTCF binding sites and changes in gene expression for genes located within TAD loops under investigation.
