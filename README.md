# Role of CTCF binding site mutations of TAD in regulation of genes and cSCC progression
This repository contains scripts used in the analysis of CTCF binding site mutation for its role in cancer progression.
1) The script named "Loop-genes-association.rmd" is used to explore the association between mutations in CTCF binding sites and changes in gene expression for genes located within TAD loops under investigation.
